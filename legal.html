                    <p>To provide an inclusive experience, Mystery Bite includes the following accessibility features:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Screen Reader Compatibility:</strong> We provide descriptive accessibilityLabels for all interactive elements, including our hand-drawn food illustrations and rarity indicators, ensuring compatibility with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android).</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Type Support:</strong> The App supports system-wide font scaling. Users can increase text size without losing functionality or encountering layout overlaps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Haptic & Auditory Feedback:</strong> For users with low vision, we provide unique vibrations (haptic feedback) and sound cues during the "blind box" opening sequence to signal success and rarity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Touch Target Optimization:</strong> All interactive buttons and cards are designed with a minimum touch area of 44x44 points to assist users with limited fine motor skills.</li>
                        <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> We carefully curate our color palettes to ensure text-to-background contrast ratios meet or exceed the 4.5:1 standard for readability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
